# Differential splicing analysis  
## 1. Introduction  
This tutorial examines differential or alternative splicing patterns between male and queen
honeybees (_Apis mellifera_).  
The original data for the tutorial was obtained from the NCBI BioProject database [PRJNA689223](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA689223).  
The study that described the generation of the data can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9156628/).  

In brief, the dataset consists of brains and gonads sampled from honeybee queens and males (drones).
