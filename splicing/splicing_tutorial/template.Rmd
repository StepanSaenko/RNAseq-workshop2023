## Introduction  
The scripts today are written in RMarkdown which allows you to write text sections, which
are not run as code while you can specify text that will be run by code by writing in
 specific sections like this one:  
 
```{r, message = FALSE}
print("You can run code here like you would in a normal R script")
## If you want to write things that are not run as code, you have to start the 
## sentence with a hash/pound ('#') symbol
 
```

We can then write sections again that we don't want to run as code.
