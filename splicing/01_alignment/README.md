## Background to steps taken in preparation for practical:  
1. Alignment of RNA-seq data  
Each sample were aligned using the short-read RNA-seq aligner STAR.  

The steps for analysis included:
- Indexing reference genome assembly, which was performed using STAR.   

- Alignment of samples against the STAR-indexed reference genome assembly.
